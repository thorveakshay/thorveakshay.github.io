I am a professional full-stack software developer with a focus on the backend. Skilled in all phases of the software development lifecycle; expert at translating business requirements into technical solutions; and fanatical about quality, usability, security, and scalability.

## Objective
Looking for an opportunity to work and upgrade oneself, as well as being involved in an organization that believes in gaining a competitive edge and giving back to the community. I'm presently expanding my solid experience in Software Engineering
  and Web Application Development. I focus on using my interpersonal skills to build good user experience and create value to end user. I hope to develop skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and use my knowledge of the Web to become
  an honest asset to the business. As an individual, I'm self-confident, and you’ll find me creative, funny and naturally passionate. I’m a forward thinker & a good team player, which others may find inspiring when working as a team.

## What I Do ?

I enjoy programming applications see them running in production environment. I love solving a complex problem by breaking them down and working on individual parts. I know user interface plays the vital role, but I am excited to explore more about the internal working of systems. Which includes,
* Software Design & Architecture
* Backend Development
* Software Performance Improvement
* Continuous Integration and Delivery
