Looking for an opportunity to work and upgrade myself, as well as being involved in an organization that believes in gaining a competitive edge and giving back to the community. I'm presently expanding my solid experience in Software Engineering and Web Application Development. I focus on using my interpersonal skills to build good user experience and create value to end user. I hope to develop skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and use my knowledge of the Web to become an honest asset to the business. As an individual, I'm self-confident, and you’ll find me creative, funny and naturally passionate. I’m a forward thinker & a good team player, which others may find inspiring when working as a team.
