I am currently working at [**PayPal, Inc.**](https://www.paypal.com/us/home) in **Core Payments Team**. 

I am passionate about `Software design`, `architecture`, and `engineering`. 
As a *Systems Engineer* at TCS, I Executed projects as a *Full-Stack developer*, with an emphasis on designing scalable services in Java/J2EE & Python.

* My team and I designed and developed **Mitsubishi** Plant Manager, Supervisor dashboards which resulted in forming `TCS-Mitsubishi $600 million joint venture.`{:.yelhglt}
* My favorite project is with **Nielsen** Company. I worked on a huge stack of technologies and many challenging projects with Nielsen. I was talking to `client daily and gathering requirements, finalizing designs.`{:.yelhglt} I worked on 3 major websites of Nielsen also handled a couple of `security threats` and Sev1 issues and reduced direct business impact.

In fall 2016, I left TCS to pursue my Master of Science in Computer Science. Also, I worked as a *Graduate Assistant (Web Developer)* at California State University, Fullerton.

## Objective
Looking for an opportunity to work and upgrade my knowledge and skills, as well as being involved in an organization that believes in *gaining a competitive edge and giving back to the community*. I'm presently expanding my solid experience in Software Engineering and Web Application Development. I focus on using my interpersonal skills to build good user experience and create value to end user. I hope to develop skills in Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning and use my knowledge of the programming to become an honest asset to the business. As an individual, I'm self-confident, and you’ll find me creative, funny and naturally passionate. I’m a forward thinker & a good team player, which others may find inspiring when working as a team.

## What I Do?
I enjoy programming applications see them running in production environment. I love solving a complex problem by breaking them down and working on individual parts. I know user interface plays the vital role, but I am excited to explore more about the internal working of systems. Which includes,
* Software Analysis & Design
* Backend Development & Engineering
* Software Performance & Security Improvement
* Continuous Integration and Delivery
