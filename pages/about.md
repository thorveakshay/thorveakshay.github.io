## Who Am I?

I am Akshay Thorve, a **Staff Software Engineer** originally from India, now building scalable systems in the Bay Area, California.

Currently, I work as a **Member of Technical Staff 1 at PayPal**, developing and enhancing the core payment platform. My work sits at the intersection of high-availability distributed systems, system architecture, and complex financial infrastructure.

With **12+ years of professional experience**, I specialize in transforming legacy systems into modern scalable architectures. You'll find me creative, funny and naturally passionate about technology—whether it's designing fault-tolerant global systems, optimizing performance, or exploring emerging AI technologies. I'm a forward thinker & collaborative team player who thrives on solving complex challenges that impact millions of users.



## Professional Journey

**2018 - Present: PayPal (MTS 1)**  
*Leading global payment architecture & modernizing legacy systems.*

Over my **7+ years at PayPal**, I've progressed from Software Engineer II to **Member of Technical Staff 1**, gaining deep expertise across the Core Payments ecosystem. My tenure has spanned both platform infrastructure and critical business features:

*   **Financial Reference Data (FReD):** Managed the backbone of payments, overseeing storage and retrieval of bank, card, and merchant data essential for processing.
*   **Payments Tools & Framework (PTF):** Developed internal monitoring and data correction tools to ensure operational health.
*   **Stored Value:** Served as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for ledger systems managing PayPal balances for millions of users.
*   **Wallet Transaction Processing (WTP):** Currently driving the **Cloud Migration** for key money-movement subsystems, modernizing the core engine of PayPal.

My focus centers on transforming these critical monoliths into scalable, cloud-native architectures:
- **Cloud Migration & App Modernization:** Spearheading the migration of Payment services from on-prem infrastructure to **Google Cloud**. This involves consolidating and simplifying complex **Java microservices** and migrating monolithic **Oracle** databases to **Google Cloud Spanner** to ensure high availability and scalability.
- **Infrastructure & DevOps Enablement:** Architected and set up the foundational Dev/QA infrastructure to enable rapid testing and deployment. Utilized **Terraform** to provision **VPCs, Kubernetes namespaces, Load Balancers, and Static IPs**, creating a self-service environment for the engineering team.
- **Technical Leadership:** Mentoring junior engineers, conducting architecture reviews, and driving technical excellence across teams to ensure scalable, maintainable code.
- **Global Scale:** Implemented IBAN validation for **83 countries**, enabling key market expansions across Europe, Asia, and beyond.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Engineered a multi-language support system for XOOM integration, saving **$1.5 Million** for the Canada launch.
- **Performance:** Re-engineered critical payment data access paths to improve system reliability and throughput.
- **Security & Compliance:** Built "Pay-Wall" features to blocklist specific financial institutes for regulatory compliance.

**2012 - 2016: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**  
*Foundational years building enterprise solutions for major global clients.*

My favorite project at TCS was with **Nielsen**, where I **designed, developed, and built backend APIs** for the Digital Rating platforms serving **Germany, Italy, and USA markets**. Using Java, Spring, and Adobe AEM, our team increased customer interaction by **30%**. I **led daily client communications**, bridging the gap between technical implementation and business requirements. My role included end-to-end ownership—from refining designs and mitigating security threats to resolving critical Sev1 production issues—underscoring the value of technical excellence in real-world applications.

Other key highlights:
- **Mitsubishi:** Designed **Plant Manager and Supervisor dashboards** using Java and Spring, achieving a remarkable **0.02-second data reflection rate**. This work helped facilitate a **$600 Million TCS-Mitsubishi joint venture**.
- **Toys"R"Us:** Built reporting APIs for **500+ pickup locations** across the USA, reducing report generation time by **50%** and achieving **97% customer satisfaction**.

**2016 - 2018: California State University, Fullerton**  
*   **Master of Science in Computer Science** (GPA: 3.74)  
    Focus: Distributed Systems | *Graduate Assistant (Web Developer)*

**2008 - 2012: University of Pune**  
*   **Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology**  
    Graduated in the **top 5% of the class**.

## What I Focus On

I love solving complex problems by breaking them down into manageable components. My work centers on building resilient, high-performance backend systems:
- **Distributed Systems Architecture** – Designing fault-tolerant services at global scale
- **System Modernization** – Transforming legacy monoliths into scalable microservices
- **Performance Engineering** – Optimizing latency and throughput for critical payment paths
- **Security & Compliance** – Building payment systems that meet stringent regulatory standards
